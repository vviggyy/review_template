Personal tool that serves a plaintext template for Google Maps reviews to a custom domain. 

Most of my reviews focus on the simple metrics included in the template, but I was spending too much time trying to phrase them. Making an easily accessible and pastable template generally lowers the activation energy, so I should be more encouraged to write them while waiting for the bill, rather than waiting until three months later, when I have 30 reviews (with corresponding pictures) lined up. 

Current stats as a [Guide](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cyqUEuAysn4SV1AC7?g_st=it):
